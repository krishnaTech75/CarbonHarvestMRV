How Carbon Credits Work
A carbon credit is a tradable certificate or permit that represents the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas.

The system works on the "Cap-and-Trade" principle, creating a market for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

1. The Goal (The "Cap"):
A governing body (like a government or an international agreement, e.g., the UNFCCC) sets a maximum limit, or a "cap," on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted by regulated companies (e.g., in energy, manufacturing, aviation). This cap is reduced over time to lower total emissions.

2. Creating Credits (The "Projects"):
Carbon credits are generated by projects that actively reduce, avoid, or remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. There are two main types:

Avoidance/Reduction Projects: These prevent emissions that would have otherwise occurred. Examples include building a wind or solar farm instead of a coal-fired power plant, or capturing methane gas from landfills.

Removal/Sequestration Projects: These actively pull CO₂ from the air. The most common natural method is afforestation (planting new forests) and reforestation. Technological methods include Direct Air Capture (DAC).

3. Verification and Issuance:
A project must be validated and verified by an independent third-party standard (like Verra (VCS) or the Gold Standard) to ensure it is real, measurable, permanent, and additional (meaning the reduction wouldn't have happened without the carbon credit revenue). Once verified, the registry issues the appropriate number of credits to the project developer.

4. Trading and Offsetting (The "Trade"):

Companies that are under the emissions cap are given or must buy emission allowances. If they emit less than their allowance, they can sell their extra credits. If they exceed their allowance, they must buy credits from others.

Voluntary Market: Companies or individuals who want to offset their own carbon footprint (e.g., from flying, manufacturing) can voluntarily purchase credits from these projects. This is called "carbon offsetting."

5. Retirement:
When a credit is used to offset an emission, it is permanently retired in a public registry to ensure it cannot be sold or used again. This guarantees that one tonne of emissions is only offset once.

In essence, the system puts a price on carbon pollution, creating a financial incentive for companies to reduce their emissions and to fund projects that benefit the environment.

Important Caveat on Plant Carbon Absorption
Calculating the exact carbon absorption of a single plant is highly complex and depends on numerous factors:

Tree Species: Different species grow at different rates and have different wood densities.

Age: A young tree absorbs less carbon than a mature, rapidly growing tree.

Climate and Location: Sunlight, rainfall, and soil quality drastically affect growth.

Density of Planting: A tree in a dense forest will grow differently than a lone tree in a field.

Lifespan and Health.

Therefore, the numbers provided below are estimates for a single, healthy, mature tree under good conditions. They are useful for comparison but should not be taken as absolute scientific values for accounting purposes. Real carbon projects measure the entire forest's sequestration, not individual trees.
