## Detailed Plan: Professional Web Application Development for MRV Solution

### 1. Vision & Scope (Refinement)

*   **Core Purpose:** To provideOkay, let's break down the detailed plan to build a professional web application (webapp) software for your Scalable MRV Solution for Agroforestry & Rice-Based Carbon Projects an. This plan covers everything from architecture to deployment, aiming for a robust, scalable, and end-to-end user-friendly product, scalable.
